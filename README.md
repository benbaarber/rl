## About
**rl** is a fully rust-native reinforcement learning library with the goal of providing a unified RL development experience, including:
 - High-performance production-ready implementations of all SoTA RL algorithms powered by the rust-native deep learning framework [burn](https://github.com/tracel-ai/burn)
 - Out of the box benchmarking multiple algorithms against eachother
 - Detailed logging and training visualization
 - Maximum extensibility for creating and testing new experimental algorithms
 - Gym environments
 - A comfortable learning experience for those new to RL
 - General RL peripherals and utility functions
